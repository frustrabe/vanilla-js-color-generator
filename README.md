# Color Generator

I am doing these exercises in order to solidify my vanilla JS knowledge.
This exercise is a simple Color Generator.
The "Simple" tab generates one of the 6 pre-defined color values inside our app.js array.
The "Hex" tab generates a randomised string to create a viable hex code.
To try it out, download the files to your local machine and drag and drop the _index.html_ file into the browser.
Enjoy!
